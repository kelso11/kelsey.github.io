           <font size= "4"> Beyond water sports, Ohiopyle is the perfect place to enjoy natures beauty.  Enjoy miles of trails for hiking, horseback riding, biking, and snowmobiling. Pack a lunch and enjoy the multiple picnic areas throughout the park. Watch wildlife in the designated Important Mammal Area of Important Bird Area. Grab your ropes and climb on the mountain ridge.  Ohiopyle offers activities year round for every outdoor enthusiast. I will highlight my favorite activities below.

<p><font size = "4">
Over 75 hiking trails are available throughout the state park. The Laurel Highlands is stunning any time of year with trails ranging from beginners to expert. Day trips are common, however, shelters are provided for overnight backpackers. Camping is also permitted in designated sections of the park.</p>
<p>My favorite hike includes visiting Cucumber Falls.  The falls itself are easy to get to and is a <i>must see</i> when visiting Ohiopyle. The 30 foot tall waterfall is impressive at any water level. Wear shoes you donâ€™t mind getting wet and venture behind the waterfall for extraordinary  pictures.

                    <p><Font size = "4">Biking is another activity that can accommodate all skill levels. The Great Allegheny Passage Rail-Trail offers a flat relaxing terrain. The trail actually starts in Pittsburgh and ends in Cumberland, MD. Bike rentals are available. </p>

<p>Mountain biking is another option for those seeking a little thrills. Multiple trails are available for mountain bikes, however, they are shared with other users. Caution is advised. Technical difficulty is high on multiple trails, therefore, it is recommended for intermediate and expert riders.
